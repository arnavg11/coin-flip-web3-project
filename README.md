# coin-flip-web3-project

In this project, I made a web3 based DApp that allows users to flip a coin and place a bet with 50-50 odds. The minimum bet is 1 wei and the contract must have a balance greater than the bet amount for the bet to go through. The contract's balance can be raised by calling the fill function in the backend of the contract.
